Bugs:

1#- Invalid write with < > << >> (see image bug1.png) (see bug3.png) doesn't happen if multiple argument? Double invalid write if printall is also called.

- Massive issue when it come down to free < > << >> ~ Seems to be an issue with how filename is stored? After more research it seems that it's getting the adress from literal_token which is dangerous.

- Weird leak that get fix if I comment one of the line (see bug2.PNG) Seems to affect nothing if commented?

3 #- << cat << cat cat | wc doesn't work properly see picture bug4.png and bug5.png

2#- Segfault with input : < Makefile
	See picture bug6.png for valgrind log

- Cmds double pointer not being null if no command? double check with me
