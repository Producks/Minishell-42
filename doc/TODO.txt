What to do and various notes ✅

• Display a new prompt when waiting for a new command ✅❗ #Refactor for later 

• Have a working history. ✅❗ Not sure if we need to make a copy like bash.

• Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path). ✅❗ // protoype works for now!

• Not use more than one global variable. Think about it. You will have to explain
its purpose ✅❗ // exit status has to be done but we only have 1

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon). ✅

• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence. ❌

• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters
in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign). ❌

• Implement redirections: ❌
	◦ < should redirect input. ✅❗ // Prototype works for now
	◦ > should redirect output. ✅❗ // Prototype works for now
	◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
	delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history! ❌
	◦ >> should redirect output in append mode ✅❗ // Prototype works for now

• Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe. ✅❗ // Prototype works for now

• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values. ❌

• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline. ✅❗ // check if leaks later

•Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash. ❌

• In interactive mode: ❌
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line. ❌
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell. ❌
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing. ❌

• Your shell must implement the following builtins: ✅❗
	◦ echo with option -n ✅❗ # More testing need to be done
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path ✅❗
	◦ pwd with no options ✅❗ # More testing need to be done
	◦ export with no options ✅❗ # More testing need to be done, also check alphabetical order
	◦ unset with no options ✅❗ # More testing need to be done and remove PATH = no env maybe? 
	◦ env with no options or arguments ✅❗ # More testing need to be done
	◦ exit with no options ✅❗ # More testing need to be done ~~ seems to work fine for now
